### RIDGE REGRESSION

Ridge regression is a regularized linear regression technique used to mitigate the problem of overfitting in statistical models. It is a modification of ordinary least squares regression that adds a regularization term to the cost function, which penalizes large coefficient values.

###Concrete Compressive Strength

The Concrete Compressive Strength problem is a regression task where the goal is to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its various attributes such as cement content, water-cement ratio, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, etc.

The dataset for this problem contains 1,030 instances with eight input variables and one output variable. The input variables are:

Cement (kg/m^3)
Blast Furnace Slag (kg/m^3)
Fly Ash (kg/m^3)
Water (kg/m^3)
Superplasticizer (kg/m^3)
Coarse Aggregate (kg/m^3)
Fine Aggregate (kg/m^3)
Age (day)
The output variable is the compressive strength of concrete in mega-pascals (MPa)


### Importing Libraries
Here we are using
 Numpy – To perform mathematical operations on arrays.
 Pandas – To load the Data frame.
 Matplotlib – To visualize the data features.
 Seaborn – To see the correlation between features using a heat map.


### LOAD THE DATASET
data = load_dataset()
The dataset contains 9 features and 1030 rows.

### Exploratory Data Analysis – EDA
 Command .shape shows the Total rows and columns present in the data.
 Command .info() gives information about the data type
 Command .describe() is used to view some of the basic statistical details like percentile, mean, std, count, min, and max values.
 Command .isnull().sum() shows the presence of null values in each column.


Here we are using different plots for visualizations like Histogram, Scatter plot, Count plot, Bar plot, Box plot etc.
Preprocessing


### Identifying and Filling the Null values
1 Filling the numeric null values with mean
   numeric.fillna(numeric.mean())
2 Imputing categorical null values with Most_frequent
SimpleImputer – one of the methods to fill the null values


imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="mode")
train_data = imputer.fit_transform(train_data)
test_data = imputer.transform(test_data)


### Encoding Categorical Data
pd.get_dummies() – dummifies the cateregorical variables


Splitting Dataset into Training & Test set
    a. Select the first n samples for the training set, where n is the calculated number of samples
    b. Select the remaining samples for the test set
train_data, test_data = train_test_split(data, test_size=test_size)




### MODEL BUILDING
 
# Inputs:
#   X: an n-by-d matrix of n instances with d features each
#   y: an n-dimensional vector of target variable values
#   alpha: the regularization parameter for ridge regression

# 1. Perform simple linear regression to calculate the coefficients
# Calculate the means of X and y
X_mean = mean(X, axis=0)
y_mean = mean(y)

# Calculate the numerator and denominator of the slope
numerator = dot(X.T, (y - y_mean))
denominator = dot(X.T, (X - X_mean))
slope = numerator / denominator
intercept = y_mean - dot(X_mean, slope)

# 2. Calculate the coefficients of the ridge regression model
# Define the regularization matrix
reg_matrix = alpha * identity(d)

# Solve for the coefficients
ridge_coefficients = inv(X.T @ X + reg_matrix) @ X.T @ y

# 3. Compare the performance of the simple linear regression and ridge regression models
# Calculate the predictions for the simple linear regression model
simple_linear_predictions = X @ slope + intercept

# Calculate the predictions for the ridge regression model
ridge_predictions = X @ ridge_coefficients

# Calculate the mean squared error for each model
mse_simple_linear = mean((y - simple_linear_predictions) ** 2)
mse_ridge = mean((y - ridge_predictions) ** 2)

# Output:
#   slope: the slope of the simple linear regression line
#   intercept: the intercept of the simple linear regression line
#   ridge_coefficients: the coefficients of the ridge regression model
#   mse_simple_linear: the mean squared error of the simple linear regression model
#   mse_ridge: the mean squared error of the ridge regression model
